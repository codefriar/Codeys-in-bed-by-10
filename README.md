# Codey's In Bed By 10pm

This is my first VS Code Theme. Special thanks to [@sdras](https://github.com/sdras) for [her article on how to make VS Code Themes](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) and for the basis of this theme: [In Bed By 7pm](https://github.com/sdras/inbedby7pm)

## About this theme

### For Salesforce Development

This theme was designed around the specific needs of Salesforce developers and features color and font emphasis selections specifically for Apex, Javascript, html and css.

### Accessible

This theme has been built, from the ground up with accessibility in mind. It exceeds contrast minimums by at least 1 point for every combination.

### For Code Comprehension

Emphasis has been made on Comments - keeping them at the forefront of the editor.
